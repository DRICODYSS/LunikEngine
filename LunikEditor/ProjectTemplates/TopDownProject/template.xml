	<ProjectDescription>The top down template features a playable character where the camera is positioned
behind and above the avatar at greater distance than in third person perspective. 
The player is controlled by using the mouse or touchscreen to click on the required 
destination and uses the navigation system to facilitate the character movement. 
This perspective is often used in action role playing games.
