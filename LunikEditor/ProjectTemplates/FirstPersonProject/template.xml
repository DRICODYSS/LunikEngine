	<ProjectDescription>The first person template features a player character (represented by a pair of arms) which
is viewed from first person perspective. The character can be moved around the level 
using keyboard, controller or virtual joystick on a touch device. Additionally the player can
look around using mouse, controller or virtual joystick on a touch device. The character 
can also pick up a gun that, using mouse, controller or virtual joystick on a touch device 
will fire a simple sphere projectile that will affect some physics objects in the level,
whilst bounce off the arena walls.
