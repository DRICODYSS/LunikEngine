	<ProjectDescription>The third person pack features a playable character where the camera is positioned behind
and slightly above the character. As the character moves using mouse, keyboard,
controller or virtual joystick on a touch device, the camera follows the character,
observing from an over-the-shoulder point of view. This perspective emphasizes the main
character and is popular in action and adventure games. The template map contains
several objects that the player can jump upon, and push around.
